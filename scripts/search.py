# Copyright: Lee H. Bergstrand (2019)
# Description: A Biopython program that takes a list of query proteins and uses local BLASTP to search
#              for highly similar proteins within a local blast database (usually a local db of a target
#              proteome). The program then BLASTPs backwards from the found subject proteins to the query
#              proteome to confirm gene orthology. Part of the BackBLAST pipeline.
#             
# Requirements: - This script requires BLAST+ 2.2.9 or later.
#               - All operations are done with protein sequences.
#               - All query proteins should be from sequenced genomes in order to facilitate backwards BLAST.
