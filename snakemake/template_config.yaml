# Config file for running the BackBLAST pipeline

## Execution settings
# Total threads to be used for all processes
threads: 1


## Phylogenetic tree
# Path to the phylogenetic tree file (newick format) corresponding to the subject genomes
  # Subject names in the tree must match subject names provided under 'subjects' below
  # OR specify 'subjects' to auto-generate a phylogenetic tree using the subject genomes via GToTree (see GToTree params below)
  # OR specify 'NA' to skip tree generation and plot the heatmap only
phylogenetic_tree_newick: NA
# Optional: set the cutoff for displayed bootstrap values. Anything greater than to equal to the cutoff will be shown.
bootstrap_cutoff: 80
# Optional: if you want to re-root your tree, then give the exact name of the tip you want to re-root by.
  # 'midpoint' will midpoint root the tree. 'NA' will keep the current tree topology.
root_name: NA


## Options for GToTree, if you want to generate the phylogenetic tree within the BackBLAST pipeline
## For these options to be used, set 'phylogenetic_tree_newick' above to 'subjects'
# Gene marker set to use for making the tree
gtotree_phylogenetic_model: "Universal_Hug_et_al.hmm"
# Keeps gene hits within this proportional threshold of the median sequence length
gtotree_sequence_length_threshold: 0.2
# Keeps genomes with this proportion of hits from the gene marker set
gtotree_minimum_hit_fraction: 0.5


## Plot settings
# Optional: Tab-separated file containing the 'subject_name' of each plotted genome, plus the 'plotting_name' that you desire to appear
  # on the final plot.
  # See testing/inputs/genome_metadata.tsv
genome_metadata_tsv: NA
# Optional: Tab-separated file containing the accession of each query gene and its corresponding gene name.
  # Should have two columns: 'qseqid' with the accession and 'gene_name' with the corresponding gene name.
  # Genes will be plotted in the order specified in this TSV file.
  # See testing/inputs/gene_metadata.tsv
gene_metadata_tsv: NA
plot_width_mm: 400
plot_height_mm: 200


## BLAST settings
# Only hits with an e-value below this number will be kept
e_value_cutoff: 1e-40
# Only hits with percent amino acid identity above this number will be kept
minimum_percent_identity: 25
# Only hits with percent query coverage above this number will be kept
minimum_query_coverage: 50

## BLAST input files
# Query files
  # query_genes contains the genes you want to do a reciprocal BLAST search with.
  # query_genome_orfs contains all predicted ORFs from the query genome (for reciprocal BLAST purposes)
query_genes: /path/to/query_gene_targets.faa
query_genome_orfs: /path/to/query.faa

# Subject files for BLAST (the name you specify will be plotted).
  # These should be ORF predictions from the genomes of the organisms of interest.
  # If you want to plot the query genome as well, then include it here.
